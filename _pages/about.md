I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Laboratory of NeuroImaging](https://loni.usc.edu/) of [Prof. Arthur W. Toga](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/arthur-w-toga/) at [Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California](https://keck.usc.edu/). My research interests include developing and improving AI/ML models for various biomedical data to understand the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.

I received my Ph.D. at Tsinghua University in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Linhong Ji](https://www.me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1051/1325.htm). During my Ph.D., As a Visiting Scholar, I went to Harvard Medical School and the [Laboratory for Translational Neurorecovery](https://ltnr.mgh.harvard.edu/) of [David Lin, MD](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20937/david-lin) Massachusetts General Hospital in 2023. My Ph.D. thesis focused on designing and using artificial intelligence to predict and uncover stroke patients' motor recovery based on neurological changes. 

I earned my master's degree at George Washington University in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Murray Loew](https://bme.engineering.gwu.edu/murray-loew) at [The Medical Imaging & Image Analysis Laboratory](https://loewlab.seas.gwu.edu/). I worked on Medical imaging based on artificial intelligence for tumor segmentation.

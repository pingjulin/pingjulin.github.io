Various rehabilitation robots have been developed to assist the movement training of the upper limbs of stroke patients, among which some have been used to evaluate the motor recovery. However, how to understand the recovery of motor function from the quantitative assessment following robot-assisted rehabilitation training is still not clear. The objective of this study is to propose a quantitative assessment method of motor function based on the force and trajectory characteristics during robotic training to reflect motor functional recovery. To assist stroke patients who are not able to move voluntarily, an assistive training mode was developed for the robot-assisted rehabilitation system based on admittance control. Then, to validate the relationship between characteristic information and functional recovery, a clinical experiment was conducted, in which nine stroke patients and nine healthy subjects were recruited. The results showed a significant difference in movement range and movement smoothness during trajectory tracking tasks between stroke patients and healthy subjects. The two parameters above have a correlation with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMU) of the involved patients. The multiple linear regression analysis showed FMU was positively correlated with parameters (R2=0.91,p<0.005). This finding indicated that the above-mentioned method can achieve quantitative assessment of motor function for stroke patients during robot-assisted rehabilitation training, which can contribute to promoting rehabilitation robots in clinical practice.

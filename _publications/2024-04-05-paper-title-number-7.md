Predicting the potential for recovery of motor function in stroke patients who undergo specific rehabilitation treatments is an important and major challenge. Recently, electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential in helping to determine the relationship between cortical neural activity and motor recovery. EEG recorded in different states could more accurately predict motor recovery than single-state recordings. Here, we design a multi-state (combining eyes closed, EC, and eyes open, EO) fusion neural network for predicting the motor recovery of patients with stroke after EEG-brain-computer-interface (BCI) rehabilitation training and use an explainable deep learning method to identify the most important features of EEG power spectral density and functional connectivity contributing to prediction. The prediction accuracy of the multi-states fusion network was 82%, significantly improved compared with a single-state model. The neural network explanation result demonstrated the important region and frequency oscillation bands. Specifically, in those two states, power spectral density and functional connectivity were shown as the regions and bands related to motor recovery in frontal, central, and occipital. Moreover, the motor recovery relation in bands, the power spectrum density shows the bands at delta and alpha bands. The functional connectivity shows the delta, theta, and alpha bands in the EC state; delta, theta, and beta mid at the EO state are related to motor recovery. Multi-state fusion neural networks, which combine multiple states of EEG signals into a single network, can increase the accuracy of predicting motor recovery after BCI training, and reveal the underlying mechanisms of motor recovery in brain activity.
